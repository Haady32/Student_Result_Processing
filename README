# Student Result Management System

A Java-based console application developed for **Assignment 1** that manages student records, calculates academic performance, and implements data persistence using File I/O and Serialization.

## 📌 Features

* **Student Data Management:** Input and store Student Name, Roll Number, and marks for 5 subjects.
* **Automated Analytics:** Automatically calculates Total Marks, Average, and assigns Letter Grades.
* **Data Persistence (Binary):** Uses `ObjectOutputStream` and `Serializable` to save records to `records.dat`, ensuring data remains available after the program closes.
* **Report Generation:** Exports a clean, formatted report of all students to a text file (`output.txt`).
* **Filtering:** Specific functionality to view all records or filter specifically for students who failed.

## 🛠️ Technical Logic

The system assigns grades based on the following average calculation:

| Average Score | Grade | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| >= 90 | A | Pass |
| >= 75 | B | Pass |
| >= 50 | C | Pass |
| < 50 | F | Fail |
